Hello World!

My name is Dan and I have spent the majority of my career around Staffing & Recruitment. Slowly, I have begun working with operations and development teams where I fell in love with Technology Development. This is my GitHub where I will be logging all my work as I continue to further my skills in Full-Stack Development.
